# Get the editor

To be able to "easily" *(in a not WYSIWYG interface)* create a ribbon in MS Office, I'm using a very old tool called `CustomOfficeUIEditor`. *Until now, I've not found any other free tool for doing this.*

The tool can be downloaded from [http://openxmldeveloper.org/blog/b/openxmldeveloper/archive/2006/05/26/customuieditor.aspx](http://openxmldeveloper.org/blog/b/openxmldeveloper/archive/2006/05/26/customuieditor.aspx).

For this purpose, I've taken a copy of the software, which can be downloaded [here](./files/OfficeCustomUIEditorSetup.zip)

CustomOfficeUIEditor is an external tool (outside MS Office) who can open an Office file and add the needed files to create a ribbon. It's possible to do this without an editor, for instance by using a software like 7-Zip since a .xlsx / .xlsm file is an archive with files and folders.
